# ðŸ“± iOS Machine Coding Rounds Repository

## ðŸš€ Introduction
This repository is focused on **iOS machine coding round** interview preparation.  
I will keep adding **real-world coding problems** that simulate actual interview scenarios â€” with emphasis on clean architecture, modular code, and best practices.

The goal is to prepare for coding rounds **not by solving random DSA problems**, but by **building small, structured apps**, similar to whatâ€™s expected in senior and lead-level iOS interviews.

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Inside
- Machine coding problems for iOS developers
- Swift, UIKit, SwiftUI, Combine, CoreData based solutions
- Clean Code, SOLID Principles, Dependency Injection
- End-to-end small app development tasks
- Interview tips and structured approaches

---

## ðŸ›  Problem Statement
- ðŸŽ¬ ## Build a **simple Todo List app** in **Swift** using **UIKit** or **SwiftUI** that lets the user:

- View a list of todo items
- Add a new todo item
- Mark items as completed

This is a **time-boxed 45-minute challenge**, so focus on core functionality and clean code.

## âœ¨ Requirements

### Features

1. **List Todos**
   - Display a list of todo items with:
     - Title
     - Completion status (checkmark or strikethrough)

2. **Add Todo**
   - A text field and a button to add a new todo
   - Todo should not be added if the field is empty

3. **Mark as Complete**
   - Tap a todo to toggle its completion status

## âœ¨ Why This Repository?
> Machine coding rounds test **how you design, structure, and implement** working solutions quickly â€” this repository is curated to help you prepare **smartly and efficiently** for that.
