# ðŸ“± iOS Machine Coding Rounds Repository

## ðŸš€ Introduction
This repository is focused on **iOS machine coding round** interview preparation.  
I will keep adding **real-world coding problems** that simulate actual interview scenarios â€” with emphasis on clean architecture, modular code, and best practices.

The goal is to prepare for coding rounds **not by solving random DSA problems**, but by **building small, structured apps**, similar to whatâ€™s expected in senior and lead-level iOS interviews.

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Inside
- Machine coding problems for iOS developers
- Swift, UIKit, SwiftUI, Combine, CoreData based solutions
- Clean Code, SOLID Principles, Dependency Injection
- End-to-end small app development tasks
- Interview tips and structured approaches

---

## ðŸ›  Topics Covered
- ðŸŽ¬ API-based Listing Apps (Movie, Product, etc.) - coming soon.

## âœ¨ Why This Repository?
> Machine coding rounds test **how you design, structure, and implement** working solutions quickly â€” this repository is curated to help you prepare **smartly and efficiently** for that.
